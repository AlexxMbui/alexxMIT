<h1><b><u>Car Rental System</u></b></h1>
<p1>If a driver decides to rent a car beforehand, they go to a car rental website or app and find a vehicle that meets their needs. Then, they book it and pay for the chosen rental period, if upfront payment is required. On the appointed day, this customer arrives at the car rental location to pick up the chosen car.</p1>
